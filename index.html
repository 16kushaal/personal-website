            <p class="about-description">
                ever since i got my first computer back in 2011, i've been hooked on the creativity and limitless possibility it holds. they weren't just machines, they were modern alchemy. And now, with AI evolving at lightspeed, i believe we're on the cusp of weaving a new reality.

            <p class="about-description">
                outside of tech, i'm drawn to the thrill of exploration, whether it's long rides on a motorcycle, trekking through the hills, or simply unplugging in the outdoors. bike rides fuels my curiosity and keeps me balanced; it's in those quiet, untethered moments where i feel most alive.

            <p class="about-description">
                on weekends, i'm passionate about turning ideas into powerful, real-world products. oh, can't forget about motorsports and tech, a combination that perfectly captures the best of my interests.
